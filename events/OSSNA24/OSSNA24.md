**[Beyond the Buzz: Navigating AI's Myths and Realities - Ezequiel Lanza, Intel](https://sched.co/1aBUD)**
Join us for an insightful discussion on artificial intelligence (AI), where we'll explore concepts like superhuman intelligence and the pursuit of general intelligence. Grounding our conversation in empirical reality, we'll also address the crucial role of licenses and open-source initiatives in shaping the AI landscape. Through a thorough examination, we'll clarify the implications of superhuman intelligence and assess our current proximity to its realization. While AI has made significant strides, achieving machines that surpass human cognitive abilities remains a distant goal. With a commitment to clarity, we'll navigate through exaggerated claims, revealing fundamental truths about AI's capabilities. Get ready for an engaging dialogue that challenges conventional perspectives and provides practical insights into the intersection of AI and reality!

**Monday, April 15, 2024 - SOSS Community Day**

**9:30-9:50am, [Connecting Supply Chain Security Projects to the Community - Exploring OpenSSF’s DevRel Mission - Katherine Druckman, Intel; Lori Lorusso, N/A; Angie Byron, Aiven; Tabatha DiDomenico, G-Research](https://sched.co/1aNLY)**
Under the hood of most software is a complex system of tooling, processes, and, ultimately, humans. Ensuring the system's integrity and hardening our software supply chain requires careful configuration at countless steps along the pipeline. Similarly, community efforts to develop standards, tools, and education also require contributions from a diverse group of technologists and communicators to keep projects, conversations, and outreach moving forward. The new OpenSSF DevRel community was formed to advance the mission of the OpenSSF by evangelizing its projects. This panel of DevRel Community volunteers will share the many ways we leverage our varied experiences to fill the critical gap between code and communication. We will further outline the many values of non-code contributions in organizations like the OpenSSF and share tips for getting involved.

**10:45-11:05am, [Critical Conversation: Consuming Open Source Securely - Katherine Druckman, Intel & Ryan Ware, Intel Corporation](https://sched.co/1aNLn)**
With the number of available open source projects seeing exponential growth, including the number of single-maintainer projects, evaluating and safely consuming open source software has never been more critical or challenging. Join Katherine Druckman, Open Source Security Evangelist at Intel, in conversation with Ryan Ware, Director of Open Source Security at Intel, to unpack the basics of secure open source consumption. Join us as we explore the fundamentals of evaluating open source projects against maintenance best practices and overall health, and cover the significance of CVEs and how they are addressed within open source projects. We will highlight the roles of project maturity and governance, documented expectations about code contributions, and clearly outlined bug-reporting processes, and how all these factors build confidence in the integrity of our software. Finally, we’ll touch on the use of tooling to help harden the development process and initiatives from the broader open source security community, like the OpenSSF and its projects, that aim to make secure open source software consumption ubiquitous.

**Wednesday, April 17 • 4:30pm - 4:40pm - ContainerCon**

**[Lightning Talk: Secure Consumption of Open Source Software: Evaluating, Utilizing, and Contributing Safely - Katherine Druckman, Intel](https://sched.co/1bmSE)**
The consumption of open source software is ubiquitous, offering immense opportunities for innovation and collaboration. However, ensuring the security of open source software requires careful evaluation, utilization, and contribution.

This talk will cover some key considerations for securely consuming open source software. Attendees will learn to evaluate projects based on active maintenance, patch cycles, and vulnerability management. We will explore the role of project documentation, code contribution expectations, and community involvement in project maturity and code quality.
