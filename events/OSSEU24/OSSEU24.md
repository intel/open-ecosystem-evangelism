**15:25 - 16:05 CEST**

**[Beyond the Buzz: Navigating AI's Myths and Realities](https://sched.co/1ejB1) - Ezequiel Lanza**

Join us for an insightful discussion on artificial intelligence (AI), where we'll explore concepts like superhuman intelligence and the pursuit of general intelligence. Grounding our conversation in empirical reality, we'll also address the crucial role of licenses and open-source initiatives in shaping the AI landscape. Through a thorough examination, we'll clarify the implications of superhuman intelligence and assess our current proximity to its realization. While AI has made significant strides, achieving machines that surpass human cognitive abilities remains a distant goal. With a commitment to clarity, we'll navigate through exaggerated claims, revealing fundamental truths about AI's capabilities. Get ready for an engaging dialogue that challenges conventional perspectives and provides practical insights into the intersection of AI and reality!

**[Simplifying Generative AI App Development: Why Standars Matter](https://sched.co/1ej3l) - Ezequiel Lanza and Katherine Druckman**

Demand for generative AI development is moving like a bullet train! Rapid innovation can move lightning-fast and produce exciting projects. Now is the time to embrace open development, refine best practices, and collaborate on standards for all to benefit. This session will outline common pain points involved in building LLM-based generative AI applications, especially those using RAG techniques, and connect them to open solutions. We will share reference architectures to help shorten developers’ paths to releasing performant AI applications to meet the needs of stakeholders and users. Finally, we’ll share community efforts, such as the Linux Foundation’s Open Platform for Enterprise AI project, to advance this critical work. Join us to explore ways to discover the untapped potential in generative AI development workflows.

**[Back to Security Basics: Evaluating, Consuming, and Contributing Open Source Software](https://sched.co/1ej6i) - Katherine Druckman**

We won! Open source software is everywhere... so now what? Shifting left starts at the beginning – ensuring the security of open source software requires careful evaluation, use, and contribution. This talk will cover some important challenges in securely consuming open source software. Attendees will learn to evaluate projects based on active maintenance, patch cycles, and vulnerability management. We will explore the role of project documentation, code contribution expectations, and community involvement in project maturity and code quality, as well as tools and community guidance. Walk away with the beginnings of a practical framework and checklist that you can mold to your own needs.
